<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

<h2 align="center">About the Project</h2>


This program is built solely with C++14 and implements multiple data structures including stacks, queues, linked lists, binary tree and simple arrays. The entire output configuration is built on a command line terminal approach and works perfectly fine with multiple user inputs.


Here's why it's so awesome:  

* We get to see the power of working with multiple data structures in C++ 😉
* We get to interact and work with large-scale programs in an object oriented language ✅

**You may also suggest changes by forking this repository and creating a pull request or opening an issue.**  

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
